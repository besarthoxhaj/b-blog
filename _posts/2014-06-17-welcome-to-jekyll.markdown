We all had lots of fun tackling the exercises in learnyouNode, a Node.js training package which is aimed at experienced coders with broad javascript skills - just like us!! Back in the real world we all realised by the start of the second day that our scattergun approach to learning from scratch wasn't going to cut it and some didacticism was required from a reluctant Dan. It was a pleasant change of pace working through the problems individually for an hour and then writing the solutions from scratch collaboratively. While it took a bit longer than expected we came out with a firmer grasp of javascript as well as a foundation in Node, new weapons in our assault on these recalcitrant machines!
